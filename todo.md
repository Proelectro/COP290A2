# Ideas
1. think of a story - divide it into small puzzles.
2. target audience  - children
3. aim - in modern times, to educate children about cyber security 
4. intro to cryptography : caesar cipher 
5. Children are bored easily - so we need to add a variety of mini games to keep them engaged.

In most countries, a large percentage of children
between the ages of eight and thirteen have access to a mobile
device at home, where monitoring and supervision by a trusted
adult is not enough, so statistics on children victimized by
bullying and damage to the integrity of their personal data have
been increasing considerably.

n this work, we design and develop a serious game, a playful
application that integrates and delivers educational content on
cybersecurity to users aged 8 to 12 years, allowing them to
have basic ideas about the responsibilities that the use of
current technologies entails. The contents raise awareness about
the use of strong passwords and vulnerabilities identification
through gamification techniques to ensure both learning and
entertainment.
